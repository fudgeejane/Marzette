                        My love for photography has always been a driving force in my life, 
                        inspiring me to record the world through my own perspective. 
                        This website is a reflection of that passion, offering a space to 
                        share not only my favorite images but also the stories and techniques 
                        behind them. I personally use my own shots because I hope to inspire 
                        people with the beauty I see, give important concepts 
                        for young photographers, and build a community that values the art of documenting passing moments.

                        I propose this project because, as we have seen, recent typhoons have had an enormous effect on many lives 
                        and houses as a result of tree and forest cover loss. The loss of our forests increases the effects of natural
                        calamities, resulting in more severe flooding, landslides, and environmental damage. Through this website we 
                        want to find solutions to this serious issue by concentrating on replanting and forest protection. Our effort aims 
                        to restore important biodiversity, reduce the consequences of climate change, and strengthen community resilience to 
                        natural disasters. Through education, advocacy, and direct action, we want to create a greener, safer future for impacted 
                        communities and the Earth as a whole.

                    <p>
                        I also want to propose that we revisit our previous project from our web development course, as our professor recognized its potential.
                        The project, which focuses on educational purposes, demonstrated significant promise in providing valuable resources and interactive 
                        content. By refining our approach and incorporating feedback, we can enhance its functionality and impact, creating a more effective 
                        platform for learning and engagement. This renewed focus will allow us to maximize its educational value, making it a useful tool for 
                        students and educators alike while showcasing our skills.
